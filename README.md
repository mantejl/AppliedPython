Python work from ITP 216: Applied Python

Became more familiar on how to leverage Python's unique features to manipulate data effortlessly, something that set Python apart from other languages. Concepts like list comprehensions, context managers, and generators were used frequently. Also  learned topics such as scientific computations, data visualization, system automation, web development, and machine learning through labs, assignments and quizzes.
